= Metrical

MetricFu is awesome! Metrical fixes some tiny issues I have with it.

* Don't make MetricFu or any metrics part of the dependencies of your project
* Works with Rails 3 and Rspec 2
* You can now run MetricFu in any directory:

	cd /path/of/your/project
	metrical

* Has been preconfigured to work with Rails
* Reek and Roodi are properly installed by metrical
* Per project configuration in a simple <tt>.metrics</tt> file

== Installation

	gem install metrical
